# Public Transit Optimization with Social Access Objectives

This repository is meant to act as a home page linking to the various programs related to the research project:

> H. Kaul and A. Rumpf. Public transit optimization with social access objectives: A case study of primary health care access for underserved communities of Chicago. In preparation, 2020.

I would not expect these programs to be of much use to anyone outside of our research group, but they are provided here for anyone interested.
